# MathWeb
We are three passionate students from Dalhousie University.

We plan to create a website dedicated for playing math games and teaching math behind each game. Our website will allow users to play different math games and learn mathematics from each game.

The project goal is to help users grow interests in mathematics in a game fashion and also learn more about math along the way.

Hope the beauty of Math can be shown in these fun awesome games. Yay!
